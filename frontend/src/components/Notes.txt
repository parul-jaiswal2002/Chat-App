first we created backend 
 1. In backend we created index.js file in which we are creating a socket server

 2. In fronted first we created UI for chat app
 and next we did npm i socket.io-client

 then we import this in chatroom component
 and initialize the socket server


 when we have to send ms we will use socket.emit
 when we have to recieve msg we will use socket.on
